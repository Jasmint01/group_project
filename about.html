<div id="column 1">
   <h1>Introduction</h1> <p> A restaurant founded back in 2016 by a group of friends after exploring the japanese cuisine. After not only exploring
        the cuisine but also the culture and the advances in technology, we started getting some ideas. We decided to explore
        the connection between food and technology and with this we formed what is now know as ServoCafe. A way to enjoy the
    company of friends and family while being waited on by robots. No longer will you wait for a waiter to come to your table.
    Simply visit our menu on our website and immediately order. </p>

    <h1>When ordering...</h1>
    <p> When ordering you can look into our various selections. We make sure that our customers can find a meal of their choice.
        No matter what they like, or are wanting to try. For example, for those who are curious customers we have featured dishes.
        Featured dishes can be found under the star icon. For those who are spice lovers, we also have options that are highlighted
        under a chili pepper icon. However, you will find all meals under menu. Feel free to explore around our website, when ready
        order your meal and your robot will over momentarily.</p>
